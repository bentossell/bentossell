## Development and Deployment

This repo uses a staging branch to test changes before going live. Work on your feature branches, then merge into `staging` for testing.

### Workflow

1. Open a pull request into `staging` and ensure the **Test** workflow passes.
2. Once validated, open a pull request from `staging` to `main` for production deployment.
3. On merge to `main`, the **Deploy** workflow automatically publishes the site using GitHub Pages.

The test workflow runs `scripts/run_tests.sh`, which performs basic checks on `index.html`.
