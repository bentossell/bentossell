# Building with AI Tools in 2024

The AI revolution isn't coming - it's here. As someone who's been investing in and using AI tools daily, I've seen how they're reshaping how we build products, write content, and stay productive.

## My Current AI Stack

Here are the tools I use every day:

### Development & Code
- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor that feels like magic
- **GitHub Copilot** - Still the gold standard for code completion
- **v0 by Vercel** - Rapidly prototype React components

### Content & Writing
- **ChatGPT** - For brainstorming, editing, and complex reasoning
- **Claude** - Excellent for long-form content and analysis
- **Granola** - AI meeting notes that actually work

### Design & Creative
- **Midjourney** - Still the best for creative image generation
- **DALL-E 3** - Great for precise, realistic images
- **Figma AI** - Design assistance within my existing workflow

## How I Use Them

### Code Generation
```javascript
// With Cursor, I can describe what I want:
// "Create a React component for a blog post card"
// And it generates something like this:

function BlogPostCard({ title, excerpt, date, tags }) {
  return (
    <article className="blog-card">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p className="excerpt">{excerpt}</p>
      <div className="meta">
        <time>{date}</time>
        <div className="tags">
          {tags.map(tag => <span key={tag}>{tag}</span>)}
        </div>
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Content Creation
I use AI to:
1. **Brainstorm** - Generate multiple angles for topics
2. **Structure** - Outline complex articles
3. **Edit** - Improve clarity and flow
4. **Research** - Quick fact-checking and idea validation

### Investment Analysis
When evaluating new companies, I use AI to:
- Analyze market trends and competitive landscapes
- Review technical documentation
- Generate questions for founder interviews
- Summarize research reports

## What's Working (and What Isn't)

### ✅ What's Working
- **Code completion** saves 30-40% of typing time
- **Content editing** makes everything more polished
- **Image generation** for quick mockups and ideas
- **Meeting transcription** frees me to focus on conversations

### ❌ What Needs Work
- **Hallucinations** still require constant fact-checking
- **Context switching** between tools breaks flow
- **Over-reliance** can hurt original thinking
- **Quality variance** means you need human judgment

## The Future I'm Betting On

Based on my investments and what I'm seeing in the market:

1. **Agent workflows** will replace point solutions
2. **Multimodal AI** will become the default interface
3. **Vertical-specific tools** will beat generalist ones
4. **Privacy-first AI** will become a competitive advantage

## Tools I'm Watching

Companies I've invested in or am excited about:
- **Wordware** - No-code AI agent builder
- **Factory** - AI-powered development workflows  
- **CrewAI** - Multi-agent collaboration frameworks

## My Advice

If you're just getting started with AI tools:

1. **Start small** - Pick one tool and master it
2. **Focus on workflow** - How does it fit your existing process?
3. **Measure impact** - Track time saved and quality improvements
4. **Stay curious** - The landscape changes monthly

The key isn't using every AI tool available - it's finding the ones that genuinely make you more effective at what you already do well.
