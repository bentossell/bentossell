# My Investment Philosophy

After investing in companies like Supabase, Etched, and Factory, I've developed a clear philosophy about early-stage investing.

## What I Look For

### Technical Founders Building Technical Tools

I focus on **technical founders** who deeply understand the problems they're solving. When you're building developer tools or infrastructure, you need to live and breathe the technology.

### The $100-200k Sweet Spot

I typically invest $100-200k per company. This amount is:
- Meaningful enough to be helpful
- Small enough to move quickly
- Right-sized for my fund structure

## Portfolio Highlights

Some companies I've backed that exemplify this philosophy:

**Supabase** - The open source Firebase alternative
- Technical team with deep database expertise
- Solving real infrastructure pain points
- Amazing community adoption

**Etched** - AI inference hardware
- Deep technical moats in chip design
- Massive market opportunity
- Strong technical founding team

**Factory** - AI-powered development tools
- Automating complex development workflows
- Technical founders who understand the space
- Clear product-market fit early on

## The Decision Framework

My investment process is simple:

1. **Technical depth** - Do they really understand the problem?
2. **Market timing** - Is this the right moment for this solution?
3. **Execution ability** - Can they actually build and ship?
4. **Community/traction** - Are people using and loving it?

## What Excites Me Most

I get most excited about tools that make other builders more productive. Whether it's infrastructure (Supabase), development tools (Factory), or AI acceleration (Etched) - I love backing the picks and shovels of the next wave of innovation.
